# TheHolyG(RLHF)AIL
Project with Zichu on connections between generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We want to show how to link the two methods into an encompassing framework and how to design better optimization techniques for this framework. We utilize concepts of hidden convex-concave games.
